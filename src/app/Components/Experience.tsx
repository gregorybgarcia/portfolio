      "Working at the external client Pagonxt (a global startup of Getnet) as a dedicated front-end developer specialized in React. I have been part of a squad focused on products for Mexico, where my routine involved bug resolution, development of new functionalities, attending meetings in Spanish with the Mexican client, coordinating and engaging in peer programming with junior and mid-level developers. This experience also provided me with a close understanding of the daily operations within a financial institution and allowed me to enhance my perception of security, project structure, and squads.",
